# 3d Deformation

This program was written to experiment with the use of chunks to build large, malleable systems that can be manipulated in real time.

To build, download the project folder.
Open the folder via Unity 5.3.3 or later.
The application can then be run inside the Unity IDE, or exported to the platform of choice via the Unity build menu.
